This game is a project by Castelldefels.
To play, copy and paste the game code from the "Game Code" file into a python compiler such as https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/.
Thank you for playing! All suggestions should be sent to me via DM.

This is probably going to be the final version of the game. If you encounter any bugs, please let me know. :)
