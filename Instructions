********INSTRUCTIONS********

TO PLAY THE GAME: Copy the code from the file that contains it and paste it into a python compiler. I use the one at https://www.programiz.com/, but which one you use is up to you.

NOTES:
  The game automatically progresses. There is no need to click on anything. When you are offered a choice, it will stop and you can type in the number of your choice.
  A lot of work went into this project, and I am relatively new to coding, so please don't judge any errors too harshly. Thank you!


****THANK YOU FOR PLAYING!!!****
